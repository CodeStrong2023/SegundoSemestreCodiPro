JAVA

Java Syntax

    - Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" has different meaning
    - Every line of code that runs in Java must be inside a class.  A class should always start with an uppercase first letter.
    - The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and
     add ".java" to the end of the filename.

The main Method
    - Any code inside the main() method will be executed. 
    - Remember that every Java program has a class name which must match the filename, and that every program must 
    contain the main() method.

System.out.println()
    - Inside the main() method, we can use the println() method to print a line of text to the screen.

    EJ: public class Main {
            public static void main(String[] args) {
                System.out.println("Hello World");
         }
        }

    Note: The curly braces {} marks the beginning and the end of a block of code.
          System is a built-in Java class that contains useful members, such as out, which is short for "output". 
          The println() method, short for "print line", is used to print a value to the screen (or a file).
          Don't worry too much about System, out and println(). Just know that you need them together to print stuff to the screen.
          You should also note that each code statement must end with a semicolon (;).

Print Text          
    - You can add as many println() methods as you want. Add a new line for each method.
    - When you are working with text, it must be wrapped inside double quotations marks "".

The Print() Method
    - There is also a print() method, which is similar to println().
    - The only difference is that it does not insert a new line at the end of the output.

Print Numbers
    - You can also use the println() method to print numbers.
    - However, unlike text, we don't put numbers inside double quotes.
    - You can also perform mathematical calculations inside the println() method.

Java Comments
    Single-line Comments:
        - Single-line comments start with two forward slashes (//).
        - Any text between // and the end of the line is ignored by Java (will not be executed).    
    Java Multi-line Comments:
        - Multi-line comments start with /* and ends with */.
        - Any text between /* and */ will be ignored by Java.
